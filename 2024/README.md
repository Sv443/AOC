# My [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions
The code and my input files can be found in the [`src/days/`](./src/days/) folder, under each day's subfolder.  
Don't get spoiled, try to solve the puzzles yourself first!

### To run:

1. Clone with git or download and extract ([click the green button here](https://github.com/Sv443/AoC))
2. Install Node.js (Current or LTS) and npm (usually comes bundled)
3. Open a terminal in the desired year's folder
4. Install pnpm with `npm i -g pnpm` and then run `pnpm i` to install dependencies

Then while still in the same folder:
- Run the latest day's code with `pnpm latest`
- Show a prompt to choose the day by just running `pnpm start`
- Run a specific day's code with `pnpm start <day>`
