# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## My solutions

<br><br>

### To run

Clone with git or download and extract (green button).  
Install Node.js (preferably v14+) and open a terminal in the project directory.  
Install dependencies with `npm i`, then use the command `npm start`  
It will prompt you to enter the day of which to run the code. Press ESC or enter `0` to run the latest day.  
Alternatively, use `node day/x`, where x could be any valid day of the advent.

### Info

Code can be found in the [`day`](./day/) folder, under each day's subfolder.

The latest version is on the branch `develop`.  
I'm doing this to prevent spoiling anyone. If you really want to look at my current day's solution, you can though.  
The day after, I will add it to the `master` branch.
