### To run

Clone with git or download and extract (green button).  
Install Node.js (v16+) and open a terminal in the project directory.  
Install dependencies with `npm i`  
  
Run a specific day's code with `npm start <day>`  
Run the latest day's code with `npm start -- -l`  
Or open a prompt to choose the day by just running `npm start`
